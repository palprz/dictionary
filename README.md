## Dictionary [February 2017]

Desktop application for read, write, edit and remove translations.

This application isn't a big one and the main goal isn't containing unique/revealing solutions. The goals for this project are:

1. Gather new skills with using new technologies:
	- JavaFX (create modern view instead of ugly solution which I could get by using Swing)
	- NoSQL database (MongoDB) for Java
  
2. Get bigger experience with using GitHub/tools dedicated for it:
	- Codacy to monitoring code quality (alternative for SonarQube)
	- creating isssues on GitHub (alternative for creating issues with using JIRA)
  
3. Working with typical company workflow:
	- using feature branches to separate specific code and to be easier reference them
	- creating issues and reference pull requests to them
	- report bugs with using issues GitHub feature
	- monitor progress of my work in different ways


### Technologies and tools:
- Java 8
- Eclipse
- Maven
- JUnit 
- MongoDB
- JavaFX (with plugin e(fx)clipse and Scene Builder 8.0)
